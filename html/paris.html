        <strong>EIFFEL TOWER</strong> 
        The Eiffel Tower is an iconic landmark that epitomizes the beauty and grandeur of Paris. This towering iron lattice
        structure, standing at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall, is located on the Champ de Mars near the Seine River.

        Designed by Gustave Eiffel and completed in 1889, the Eiffel Tower was initially built as the entrance arch to the
        Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. It
        was intended to be a temporary structure, but its popularity and significance led to its preservation.
